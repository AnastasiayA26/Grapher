# Grapher

Grapher is an application designed for visualizing mathematical functions. Users can input mathematical expressions, and the application will create interactive graphs for these functions. A special mathematical keyboard is provided to facilitate the input of complex mathematical symbols and functions.

## Features

- **Function Input**: Enter mathematical functions using a special keyboard.
- **Interactive Graph Plotting**: Visualize functions on a dynamic graph with adjustable ranges.
- **Function Management**: Add and delete functions from the list.
- **Visibility Toggle**: Show or hide functions on the graph.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Library for building the user interface.
- **Plotly.js**: Library for creating interactive graphs and charts.
- **JavaScript**: The main programming language of the project.

## Prerequisites
